##  condor_config
##
##  This is the global configuration file for condor. This is where
##  you define where the local config file is. Any settings
##  made here may potentially be overridden in the local configuration
##  file.  KEEP THAT IN MIND!  To double-check that a variable is
##  getting set from the configuration file that you expect, use
##  condor_config_val -v <variable name>
##
##  condor_config.annotated is a more detailed sample config file
##
##  Unless otherwise specified, settings that are commented out show
##  the defaults that are used if you do not define a value.  Settings
##  that are defined here MUST BE DEFINED since they have no default
##  value.

##  Where have you installed the bin, sbin and lib condor directories?   
RELEASE_DIR = /usr/local/condor

##  Where is the machine-specific local config file for each host?
LOCAL_CONFIG_FILE = /home/lincolnb/.bosco/condor_config.local

##  The normal way to do configuration with RPMs is to read all of the
##  files in a given directory that do not match a regex as configuration files.
##  Config files are read in lexicographic order.
LOCAL_CONFIG_DIR = $(LOCAL_DIR)/config
#LOCAL_CONFIG_DIR_EXCLUDE_REGEXP = ^((\..*)|(.*~)|(#.*)|(.*\.rpmsave)|(.*\.rpmnew))$

##  Use a host-based security policy. By default CONDOR_HOST and the local machine will be allowed
use SECURITY : HOST_BASED
##  To expand your condor pool beyond a single host, set ALLOW_WRITE to match all of the hosts
#ALLOW_WRITE = *.cs.wisc.edu
