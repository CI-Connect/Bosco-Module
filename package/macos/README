It is STRONGLY ENCOURAGED to deactivate MacPorts, Homebrew, etc
before building a redistributably copy of Connect Client.  Do this by
removing them from your PATH before building.  The mkapp script will
attempt to use the system Python by updating its internal PATH to look
in /usr/bin first, but there can still be some hitches.

From a stock MacOS system, you will need to install pip:
	sudo easy_install pip

You will also need XCode and the XCode command line tools.  Note that
if you have not run XCode command line tools before, you may need to do
so as root before building this app, in order to accept Apple's XCode
TOS.

To build a Mac relocatable application, run the mkapp script.  Pass
the version number (with or without build details) as an argument.

cd connect-client		# where you cloned or unzipped the software
package/macos/mkapp 0.5.4

After some churning, you'll find the application in ./dist:

ls dist
...


The application may be moved around at will.  Installing the Connect
Client is simply a matter of copying it onto your hard drive.  It can
live anywhere.

Note that there is no graphical application for the Connect Client.
Connect Client exists only in the command line terminal (Terminal.app,
or iTerm, etc.)  Running the app from Finder only updates your shell
settings to be able to locate the software.

After installing the application, you should run it once from Finder to
ensure that your terminal path is up to date.

Run the application from Finder again any time you move the application
to a new location.
